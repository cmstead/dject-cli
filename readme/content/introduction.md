Dject CLI is the companion tool to Dject for simplifying setup and use of the Dject dependency injection system.

The goal of this project is to simplify:

- Setup of a Node, require-based Dject configuration
- Setup for compile-at-build Dject configuration file for import-based projects
- Running build-time import-based Dject configuration
