Dject CLI has not been published on NPM yet.  Once published Dject CLI can be installed one of two ways:

- `npm i --global dject-cli`
- `npm i dject-cli --save-dev`

Dject CLI is a development and build-time tool, and is not meant to be deployed in a production environment and should be treated as insecure for any publicly available APIs.
