## Introduction ##
Dject CLI is the companion tool to Dject for simplifying setup and use of the Dject dependency injection system.

The goal of this project is to simplify:

- Setup of a Node, require-based Dject configuration
- Setup for compile-at-build Dject configuration file for import-based projects
- Running build-time import-based Dject configuration

    

## Installation ##
Dject CLI has not been published on NPM yet.  Once published Dject CLI can be installed one of two ways:

- `npm i --global dject-cli`
- `npm i dject-cli --save-dev`

Dject CLI is a development and build-time tool, and is not meant to be deployed in a production environment and should be treated as insecure for any publicly available APIs.
